# Car Calculations

## Purpose

To determine if it makes sense to purchase a particular car.

This will be a multi-faceted look at the various variables of car purchasing.
It will inform the buyer to determine wants vs needs. To not allow false reasoning
to justify a car purchase. For example, a new car that get's slightly better gas mileage.
But, at what cost does this small bump in gas effiency cost? Does it make sense? When
is the break-even?

## Key Areas

**Gas Mileage Calculations**

This should determine how much is saved between cars based on how much a person drives.
The variables of concern are mpg, miles driven each month, cost of gasoline per gallon
between cars (to account for octane requirement differences)

**Insurance Premiums**
We should be able to compare the price to insure each driver based on national averages.
The user can manually input the cost per month of insurance for each car for now. Then we 
can compare the two.


**Maintenance**
The maintenance can differ greatly between cars. Especially considering older cars vs newer cars.
The point of this comparison is to make it abundantly clear that all cars require maintenance, and that 
a cost can be associated with the car. We can compare this to having a car payment though.

**Car Payments**
If there are any payments.

## Use Cases

**Find out how much it costs/saves with a certain mpg**
A user wants to buy a new car because they're tired of their car which get's 20mpg.
They want to upgrade by purchasing a new car that get's 50mpg. We want to show how much 
money is saved each month. We also want to ask the user the question, "How much is the car payment?".
This way, we can make it abundantly clear if there is any savings or if the user is just using this 
as an excuse.
